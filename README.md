> ### About this repository
>
> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's
> **publicly available** API surface, maintained by [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com).
> API Evangelist does not operate, host, resell, or support this company's APIs, and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is
> required, and you do not need to justify the request.
>
> - **Something wrong?** Open an issue on this repository, or email
>   [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com).
> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within
> **two business days**; corrections and re-scores within **five business days**.
>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

The University of Florida (UF) is a public land-grant research university in Gainesville, Florida, United States, ranked #215 in the QS World University Rankings 2025. This repository catalogs UF's public developer and API footprint as an [APIs.json](https://apisjson.org) provider profile. UF has no single centralized public developer portal; this profile aggregates the public and community-documented data endpoints that could be verified.

- APIs.json: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-evangelist/university-of-florida/refs/heads/main/apis.yml
- Run with Naftiko: https://github.com/naftiko/fleet?utm_source=api-evangelist&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=university-of-florida-api-evangelist&utm_content=repo

- **UF Campus Map JSON Data** — JSON datasets for buildings, bus stops, dining, parking and housing. Docs: https://github.com/Rolstenhouse/uf_api (base: `https://campusmap.ufl.edu/library/cmapjson/`)

## Notes

All endpoints were probed on 2026-06-03. The SOC API returns live course JSON (HTTP 200) when called with a term parameter; the campus map JSON host responds but blocks automated/non-browser clients (HTTP 403); UFDC OAI-PMH/RSS feeds are documented by UF Library Technology Services with an OpenAPI (Swagger) API noted as forthcoming. The SOC and campus map APIs are community documented (Rolstenhouse/uf_api), not officially published by UF. Gated identity, SIS and enterprise integration APIs behind UFIT authentication are excluded. No endpoints were fabricated.
